This is my first attempt at R. 

Hello, R! : ) 

The example is based on the membership data for the Vancouver R and Data Visualization Meetup groups. 

To get the latest data, use the attached html file after editing the MeetupAPIKey. You can get your key from http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/

Legend: 
The Membership Info thermometers are filled based on the number of topics the member has selected on their profile. Their color is based on whether they have posted a member photo. 

Challenge: 
The Membership Info visualization becomes inadequate when the member names are added to the picture.
How do the graphs scale? Do we need to replace the unit of measure?

TODO: 
Histograms of usage based on the time of day
Overlay meetup events as circles (d = #of people) - do events it impact usage?
Add legends, better labels, etc.
